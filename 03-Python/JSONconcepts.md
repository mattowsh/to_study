It’s great but it’s still not persistent: every time you launch the program, you don’t restore all objects created before… The first way you will see here is to save these objects to a file.

Writing the dictionary representation to a file won’t be relevant:

Python doesn’t know how to convert a string to a dictionary (easily)
It’s not human readable
Using this file with another program in Python or other language will be hard.
So, you will convert the dictionary representation to a JSON string. JSON is a standard representation of a data structure. With this format, humans can read and all programming languages have a JSON reader and writer.
